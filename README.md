# Haskell_mastermind
This is implementation of mastermind game using knuth algorithm in HASKELL

This contains two parts one main function and another mastermind function which does all the necessary operations.

# COMPILATION
# STEP 1:
Compile the haskell programs after navigating to respective directory using :
```
ghc -o mastermind Main.hs Mastermind.hs
```
# STEP 2:
Execte the code using :
```
./mastermind
```
The knuth algorithm is used here for tracking out the various possibilities for a given code to be gussed by the 
computer in 5 guesses.

The execution looks like this:
```
MASTERMIND
a)Computer Solving your Algorithm
b)Human VS Human
c)computer Generated code
Enter the type of game to be played(a,b,c)
```
So next we can select a,b,c for computer guessing the code entered and human guessing the code entered by 
other human and human guessing the code generated by computer.

4-digit code has to be entered here with each digit ranging from 0-5.

This is nice implementation of Mini-Max algorithm which is used in AI algorithms.

The reason for using haskell is that it can do AI based rigorous computations faster.
